## Description

It allows users to Track all the Video Streaming Services that they have subscribed to. It will allow them to keep track of the money that they're spending on a monthly basis on Video Streaming subscriptions. It will also allow the users to lookup different shows that they're watching/want to watch and find out which streaming service has them. It will let them know if the show that they want to watch is already available to them in one of the services that they've subscribed to or if they should subscribe to a new service to be able to watch that show. The app will also make recommendations regarding how they're using their subscriptions and if they need to cancel some service or other.

The app is built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node. GraphQL API with Apollo Server is used to perform queries and mutations.
